# WTC_Code_Clinics
This was a group project at WTC, to create a python program using the Google API to book calendar events for a code clinics event.

To Start the code run: "./app"

Once you have started you need to link to your WeThinkCode email to the calendar, it only works with a WeThinkCode email.

You can run "python3 app help" to find all the commands below to help you run the program and book your slots.
